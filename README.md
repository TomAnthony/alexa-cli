# alexa-cli

A command-line interface for controlling Amazon Alexa devices using the unofficial Alexa API.

**Control your smart home from the terminal.** Turn lights on/off, adjust thermostats, lock doors, play music, make announcements - anything you can say to Alexa, you can script.

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew install buddyh/tap/alexacli
```

### Go

```bash
go install github.com/buddyh/alexa-cli/cmd/alexa@latest
```

### Build locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/buddyh/alexa-cli
cd alexa-cli
make build
./bin/alexacli --help
```

## Authentication

This CLI uses Amazon's unofficial API (the same one the Alexa app uses). You'll need to obtain a refresh token using the [alexa-cookie-cli](https://github.com/adn77/alexa-cookie-cli) tool.

### Step 1: Get your refresh token

Download alexa-cookie-cli from the [releases page](https://github.com/adn77/alexa-cookie-cli/releases), then:

```bash
# For US Amazon accounts
./alexa-cookie-cli --amazonPage amazon.com --baseAmazonPage amazon.com --amazonPageProxyLanguage en_US --acceptLanguage en-US
```

This opens a local proxy at http://127.0.0.1:8080. Log into your Amazon account there, and the refresh token will be displayed.

### Step 2: Configure alexa-cli

```bash
# Interactive
alexacli auth

# Direct
alexacli auth <your-refresh-token>

# Or set environment variable
export ALEXA_REFRESH_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

Configuration is stored in `~/.alexa-cli/config.json`.

## Usage

### List Devices

```bash
# List all Echo devices
alexacli devices

# JSON output for scripting
alexacli devices --json
```

### Text-to-Speech

```bash
# Speak on a specific device
alexacli speak "Hello world" -d "Kitchen Echo"

# Announce to ALL devices
alexacli speak "Dinner is ready!" --announce

# Device name matching is flexible
alexacli speak "Build complete" -d Kitchen
alexacli speak "Build complete" -d "Living Room"
```

### Voice Commands (Smart Home Control)

Send any command as if you spoke it to Alexa. This is the primary way to control smart home devices:

```bash
# Smart home control - lights, switches, plugs
alexacli command "turn off the living room lights" -d Kitchen
alexacli command "turn on the porch light" -d Kitchen
alexacli command "dim the bedroom lights to 50 percent" -d Bedroom

# Thermostats and climate
alexacli command "set thermostat to 72 degrees" -d Bedroom
alexacli command "what's the temperature inside" -d Kitchen

# Locks and security
alexacli command "lock the front door" -d Kitchen

# Play music
alexacli command "play jazz music" -d "Living Room"
alexacli command "stop" -d "Living Room"

# Ask questions
alexacli command "what's the weather" -d Kitchen

# Timers and reminders
alexacli command "set a timer for 10 minutes" -d Kitchen
```

The `-d` flag specifies which Echo device processes the command. The device itself doesn't need to be near the smart home device - Alexa routes the command appropriately.

### Ask (Get Response Back)

Send a command and capture Alexa's text response:

```bash
# Query and get the response
alexacli ask "what's the thermostat set to" -d Kitchen
# Output: The thermostat is set to 68 degrees.

alexacli ask "what's on my calendar today" -d Kitchen
# Output: You have 2 events today. First, standup at 9 AM...

# JSON output for parsing
alexacli ask "what time is it" -d Kitchen --json
# {"data":{"device":"Kitchen","question":"what time is it","response":"The time is 3:22 PM."},"success":true}
```

This retrieves Alexa's actual response by polling the voice activity history. Useful for:
- Querying smart home device state
- Getting Alexa-specific information (calendar, reminders, timers)
- Verifying that commands worked

### History

View recent voice activity:

```bash
alexacli history
alexacli history --limit 5
alexacli history --json
```

Shows what was said and what Alexa responded with.

### Alexa+ (LLM Conversations)

Interact with Alexa+ (Amazon's LLM-powered assistant) via text. Alexa+ is Amazon's newer LLM-powered backend that provides conversational AI responses.

#### Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
# Just specify the device - conversation ID is auto-selected
alexacli askplus -d "Echo Show" "What's the capital of France?"

# Multi-turn conversations retain context
alexacli askplus -d "Echo Show" "What about Germany?"
```

The `-d` flag automatically finds the most recent conversation for that device.

#### List Conversations

```bash
# See all Alexa+ conversations with devices and last activity
alexacli conversations
```

Output:
```
Found 12 Alexa+ conversation(s):

  Device: Echo Show
  ID:     amzn1.conversation.b2925036-7d5b-461f-a989-04574eb6f2c9
  Last:   2026-01-14 10:30:15

  Device: Kitchen
  ID:     amzn1.conversation.f7277f37-6a7b-4bee-b686-7f3be990f44d
  Last:   2026-01-13 18:22:03
  ...
```

#### Advanced: Use Specific Conversation ID

```bash
# If you need a specific conversation thread
alexacli askplus -c "amzn1.conversation.xxx" "Hello"
```

#### View Conversation History

```bash
# See the full conversation thread
alexacli fragments "amzn1.conversation.xxx"
```

Output shows both your messages (USER) and Alexa's responses (ALEXA):
```
[2026-01-14 10:30:15] USER
  What's the capital of France?

[2026-01-14 10:30:17] ALEXA
  The capital of France is Paris...
```

**Alexa+ features:**
- Conversational AI with persistent context
- Multi-turn conversations
- Complex reasoning and creative tasks
- Source citations when applicable

> **Note:** Requires Alexa+ to be enabled on your Amazon account.

### Audio Playback

Play MP3 audio through Alexa devices using SSML:

```bash
# Play audio from HTTPS URL
alexacli play --url "https://example.com/audio.mp3" -d "Echo Show"
```

Requirements:
- MP3 format: 48kbps bitrate, 22050Hz sample rate
- HTTPS URL with valid SSL certificate
- Convert audio: `ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -ar 22050 -ab 48k -ac 1 output.mp3`

### Routines (Coming Soon)

```bash
# List available routines
alexacli routine list

# Execute a routine
alexacli routine run "Good Night"
```

### Direct Smart Home API (Coming Soon)

For granular, programmatic control of smart home devices without natural language:

```bash
# List smart home devices with IDs and capabilities
alexacli sh list

# Direct device control by name
alexacli sh on "Kitchen Light"
alexacli sh off "All Lights"
alexacli sh brightness "Bedroom Lamp" 50
```

> **Note:** For most use cases, especially AI agents, `alexacli command` is recommended. Natural language commands are more flexible and match how you'd interact with Alexa verbally. The direct API is useful when you need exact device IDs or want to avoid natural language parsing.

## JSON Output

All commands support `--json` for machine-readable output:

```bash
alexacli devices --json | jq '.[].name'
alexacli speak "test" -d Kitchen --json
```

## Command Reference

| Command | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `alexacli devices` | List all Echo devices | Working |
| `alexacli speak <text> -d <device>` | Text-to-speech on device | Working |
| `alexacli speak <text> --announce` | Announce to all devices | Working |
| `alexacli command <text> -d <device>` | Voice command (smart home, music, etc.) | Working |
| `alexacli ask <text> -d <device>` | Send command, get response back | Working |
| `alexacli history` | View recent voice activity | Working |
| `alexacli conversations` | List Alexa+ conversation IDs | Working |
| `alexacli fragments <id>` | View Alexa+ conversation history | Working |
| `alexacli askplus -c <id> <text>` | Send message to Alexa+ LLM | Working |
| `alexacli play --url <url> -d <device>` | Play MP3 audio via SSML | Working |
| `alexacli auth` | Configure authentication | Working |
| `alexacli routine list` | List routines | WIP |
| `alexacli routine run <name>` | Execute routine | WIP |

> **Note:** Routines and Direct Smart Home API are work-in-progress. Use `alexacli command` for smart home control - it's fully working and actually preferred for AI/agentic use since natural language is more flexible than device IDs.

## Use Cases

### Claude Code / AI Agent Integration

This CLI was built specifically to allow AI assistants to control smart home devices. The natural language `command` interface is ideal for agentic use - the AI can construct commands the same way a human would speak to Alexa:

```bash
# AI can control any smart home device using natural language
alexacli command "turn off all the lights" -d Kitchen
alexacli command "set the thermostat to 68" -d Kitchen
alexacli command "lock the front door" -d Kitchen

# Notifications and announcements
alexacli speak "The build finished successfully" -d Office
alexacli speak "Reminder: standup in 5 minutes" --announce
```

### Scripting and Automation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Announce when a long-running job finishes
make build && alexacli speak "Build complete!" --announce
```

### Home Automation

```bash
# Morning routine script
alexacli command "good morning" -d Bedroom
alexacli command "turn on kitchen lights" -d Kitchen
alexacli command "what's on my calendar today" -d Kitchen
```

## Token Refresh

The refresh token is valid for approximately 14 days. If you get authentication errors, run `alexacli auth` again with a fresh token from alexa-cookie-cli.

## Troubleshooting

### "not configured" error

Run `alexacli auth <token>` to configure your refresh token.

### Device not found

Use `alexacli devices` to see exact device names, then match them in your commands. Partial matching is supported.

### Command not working

Try running the same command with `alexacli command` instead - this sends it as a voice command which has broader support.

## How It Works

This CLI uses the same unofficial API that the Alexa mobile app uses. It:

1. Exchanges your refresh token for session cookies
2. Obtains a CSRF token from alexa.amazon.com
3. Sends commands to pitangui.amazon.com (US) or layla.amazon.com (EU)

This approach is used by many popular projects including [alexa-remote-control](https://github.com/thorsten-gehrig/alexa-remote-control) and [Home Assistant's Alexa integration](https://github.com/alandtse/alexa_media_player).

## Disclaimer

This is an unofficial tool that uses Amazon's private APIs. It may break at any time if Amazon changes their API. Use at your own risk.
